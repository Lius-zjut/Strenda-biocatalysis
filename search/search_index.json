STRENDA biocatalysis aims to define which ATTRIBUTES should be used to describe an experiment in biocatalysis. Exactly for this, the following catalogue was designed and built in an adaptive modular way. While the primary focus remains on enzymatic transformations themselves, the broader landscape of biocatalysis, including aspects such as product purification, analytics, and experimental processes, is also acknowledged.</p> <p>These complementary aspects of biocatalysis, though essential, are not within the scope of this first version of the STRENDA biocatalysis guidelines. It's important to note that not all attributes are required for every experiment. Decision trees indicating mandatory attributes will be provided in the future. Currently, our focus is on compiling a comprehensive list of all attributes.</p> <p>The structure of each attribute comprises a \"type\" determining the data format and a \"description\" providing detailed insights into the required metadata. Possible format types include \u2018PosFloat\u2019 (for positive real numbers), \u2018Float\u2019 (covering all real numbers), and \u2018String\u2019 (for free text).</p> <p>Feel free to explore the valuable information in this catalogue and join in standardizing enzymatic reaction data. On this website, the ATTRIBUTES (metadata) are organised in following seven main CATEGORIES, which are visualised as icons. Please click on the icons below to open the next level and review the ATTRIBUTES.
