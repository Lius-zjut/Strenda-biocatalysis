classes:
  SamplingDescription:
    description: Information about the sampling process, used during the experiment. In some experiments no sampling is taking place at all, for example, if an experiment is monitored via a photospectrometer in a 96-well plate over time.
    attributes:
      volume_per_sample:
        description: Volume of the collected sample.
        required: true
        range: float
        minimum_value: 0
      mixing_during_sampling:
        description: Provide information about whether the reaction was mixed during sampling, as this can affect the representativeness of the collected sample.
        required: true
      volume_per_sample_unit:
        description: Common units include mL (milliliters), Î¼l (microliters), g (grams), or other volume units, depending on whether the samples are liquid or solid.
        required: true
      vessel_opened_for_sampling:
        description: Information about whether the reaction vessel was opened for sampling or not.
        required: true
      gas_phase:
        description: Information about the composition of the gas phase above the reaction solution, including gases such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, argon, oxygen or other gases.
        required: true
      time:
        description: The time at which the sample was taken.
        required: true
        range: float
  SamplePreprocessing:
    description: Sample preprocessing involves the necessary steps taken to prepare and treat collected samples before analysis or further experimentation.
    attributes:
      treatment_procedure:
        description: Any further details regarding the sample processing steps that were carried out after it was collected from the reaction vessel (e.g., filtering samples).
        required: true
      quenching_ratio:
        description: Information about the precise ratio or volume of the quenching solution in relation to the reaction mixture. ( if_applicable )
        required: true
      quenching_method:
        description: Techniques or methods used to halt the reaction, including the chemicals or procedures employed (e.g., heat treatment). Accurate documentation of quenching methods in enzymatic reactions is vital as        these methods can significantly impact subsequent analytical procedures. For instance, opting for an organic solvent as a quenching reagent can notably enhance the solubility of substrates or products, directly         influencing downstream analyses.
        required: true
      special_treatment:
        description: If there are any other specific methods, procedures, characteristics or aspects related to the sampling that are important for reproducibility and are not described by the aforementioned                     metadata, they should be explained here.
        required: true
  SamplingFromHeterogeneousReactionSolutions:
    description: Sample preprocessing
    attributes:
      phase:
        description: Information about which phase the sample was taken from must be provided.
        required: true
      biocatalyst_in_phase:
        description: Information on whether the collected sample may be contaminated with the (bio)catalyst.
        required: true
      special_treatment:
        description: If there are any other specific methods, procedures, characteristics or aspects related to the sampling that are important for reproducibility and are not described by the aforementioned                     metadata, they should be explained here.
