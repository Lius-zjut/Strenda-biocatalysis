      "description": "Yield represents the amount of the desired product obtained from a reaction. It is the number of synthesized molecules of product per number of starting molecules. The following formula can be used: $$Y_p = \\frac{n_p - n _ {p0}}{n _ {s0}} \\cdot \\frac{|v_s|}{|v_p|}$$ where, Yp  - yield of the product p  (-), np0  - amount of product p  at the start of the reaction (mol), np  - amount of product p  at the end of the reaction (mol), vs  - stoichiometric factor for the substrate s  (-), vp  - stoichiometric factor for the product p  (-). Note: The reported yield relies on analytical findings. Typically, the isolated yield is more common in practice as it reflects the precise quantity of product acquired post downstream processing (DSP).",
