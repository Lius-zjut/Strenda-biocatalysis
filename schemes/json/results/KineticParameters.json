  "title": "KineticParameters",
  "type": "object",
  "description": "These parameters serve as benchmarks for understanding enzyme kinetics. The Km and kcat value is determined by all substrates involved in the reaction and not just one. Therefore, the concentrations of all substrates must be varied and the Km and kcat values calculated to obtain a common value instead of apparent values. For a comprehensive report around the technical key data of the kinetic parameters, see literature for further information, e.g. Pesci _et al._1, Bisswanger 2 .",

      "title": "catalytic_efficiency",
      "type": "number",

      "title": "hill_coefficient",
      "type": "number",
      "description": "The Hill coefficient is a parameter used to describe cooperativity in the binding of molecules to proteins. It is employed in enzyme reactions, e.g. oxygen binding to hemoglobin, to indicate whether there is positive (cooperative) or negative (anticooperative) binding. A Hill coefficient greater than 1 indicates positive cooperativity, while a value less than 1 indicates negative cooperativity. A value of exactly 1 indicates no cooperativity."
