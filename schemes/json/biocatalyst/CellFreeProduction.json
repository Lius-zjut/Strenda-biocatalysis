  "description": "Cell-free enzyme production or gene expression refers to a process where the synthesis of the biocatalyst occurs outside of living cells. This technique involves extracting cellular components, such as ribosomes, DNA, RNA, and other necessary cellular machinery, and using them in a controlled environment (usually in vitro) to produce proteins or enzymes. For further information see, e.g. Khambhati _et al._1."
