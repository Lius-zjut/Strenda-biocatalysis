  "description": "Cell-free enzyme production or gene expression refers to a process where the synthesis of the biocatalyst occurs outside of living cells. This technique involves extracting cellular components, such as ribosomes, DNA, RNA, and other necessary cellular machinery, and using them in a controlled environment (usually in vitro) to produce proteins or enzymes. For further information see, e.g. Khambhati _et al._1.",

There are numerous methods available to determine protein content, yet only a few are suitable for estimating or determining the protein content of the target protein within a mixture. Some of these methods include activity assays or the Western blotting technique, which relies on prior SDS-PAGE and antibody binding for detection."
