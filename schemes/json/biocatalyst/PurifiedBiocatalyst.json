      "description": "The activity of the biocatalyst can be expressed either as volumetric activity, which considers the total activity of the enzyme in the solution, or as specific activity, which takes into account the       enzyme's purity and indicates the activity of an enzyme per unit of enzyme protein or enzyme mass. If the biocatalyst has been purchased, it is advisable to look up more precise information (e.g. via an SOP)            regarding the activities specified by the manufacturer, as these may differ from the values determined by yourself (different activity assays can lead to different activity values). In addition, the loss of activity of the biocatalyst over the storage period should be taken into account."
