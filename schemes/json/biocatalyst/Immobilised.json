These linkers play a vital role in stabilizing the immobilized enzymes and can           influence the efficiency and functionality of the immobilization process. They facilitate binding between the enzymes and the carrier material, promoting a stable and active biocatalyst structure. Common and            widespread linkers are spacer molecules, crosslinkers, avidin-biotin or silane coupling agents. (",

For immobilized enzymes, methods such as protein measurement or enzymatic activity assays can be used. The protein determination can be determined on the carrier material using a BCA test or as a differential measurement using the Bradford method, $\\Delta$280 or also after detachment of the enzyme from the carrier material. An activity measurement is best suited as it provides the activity per gram of immobilized material. For immobilized cells, methods like flow cytometry or biomass measurement are applicable.",
