# Results documentation

This category serves as an extension of the actual metadata catalog and deals with recommendations for the documentation and analysis of the results of biocatalytic experiments. It covers a variety of metrics and parameters based on the [STRANDA Guidelines](https://www.beilstein-institut.de/en/projects/strenda/) for improving the reproducibility of experiments within the field of biocatalysis.

## Kinetic parameters

Kinetic parameters provide key insights into the efficiency and performance of an enzymatic reactions. Parameters like K<sub>m</sub>, V<sub>max</sub>, and k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> elucidate the enzyme-substrate interaction and can further be used for optimizing reaction conditions.

<details> <Summary>Kinetic parameters</Summary>

### KineticParameters

These parameters serve as benchmarks for understanding enzyme kinetics. The K<sub>m</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub> value is determined by all substrates involved in the reaction and not just one. Therefore, the concentrations of <ins>**all**</ins> substrates must be varied and the K<sub>m</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub> values calculated to obtain a common value instead of apparent values. For a comprehensive report around the technical key data of the kinetic parameters, see literature for further information, e.g. [Pesci _et al._<sup>1</sup>](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-57619-9_4), [Bisswanger <sup>2</sup>](https://doi.org/10.1002/9783527806461) .

## Thermodynamic parameters

These parameters offer insights into energy changes occurring during the reaction and assist in estimating reaction heat, entropy, and free energy. Understanding the thermodynamic properties of a reaction is essential to determine reaction direction, stability of intermediates, and the level of spontaneity or enforcement of a reaction, but is beyond the scope of the current project phase.

<details> <Summary>Thermodynamic parameters</Summary>

### ThermodynamicParameters

Understanding the energy dynamics and spontaneity of reactions through thermodynamic parameters is essential for efficient biocatalysis. For a comprehensive report around the technical key data of the kinetic parameters, see literature for further information, e.g. [Heintz<sup>6</sup>](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-49922-1).


- __gibbs_free_energy_change__
  - Type: string
  - Description: The Gibbs free energy (__G__) represents the portion of energy capable of performing work in a reaction under constant temperature and pressure, providing insights into the spontaneity of the reaction. While the absolute value of the free energy cannot be measured directly, the change in free energy (Œî**G**) throughout the reaction, known as free reaction enthalpy, is measurable. As indicated by the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, it depends on changes in enthalpy (heat content) and entropy (system disorder) during the reaction. <br>
Œî**G** < 0: The reaction proceeds spontaneously; it is __exergonic__. <br>
Œî**G** = 0: The system is at equilibrium; no work is performed. <br>
Œî**G** > 0: The reaction does not proceed spontaneously; it is __endergonic__. A supply of free energy is required to drive the reaction.

- __enthalpy_change__
  - Type: string
  - Description: The enthalpy (**H**) represents the heat content within a system, expressing the quantity and nature of chemical bonds. This thermodynamic property cannot be measured independently. However, measurable is the change in enthalpy (Œî**H**), which refers to the amount of heat absorbed or released during a chemical reaction (under constant pressure), also known as the reaction enthalpy. <br>
Œî**H** > 0: Heat energy is supplied; the reaction is __endothermic__. <br>
Œî**H** < 0: Heat energy is released; the reaction is __exothermic__.

- __entropy_change__
  - Type: string
  - Description: The entropy (**S**) is a measure of the degree of disorder in a system or the likelihood of a state. Systems inherently tend towards maximum disorder. Every natural process involves an increase in entropy (disorder). If entropy decreases in one area, it must increase elsewhere correspondingly. The increase in entropy can act as a driving force. <br>
Œî**S** > 0: The disorder of the system increases. <br>
Œî**S** < 0: The disorder of the system decreases.
