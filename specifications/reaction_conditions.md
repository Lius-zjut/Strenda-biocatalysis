# Reaction conditions

The reaction conditions constitute a highly complex and extensive category. Reactions can be performed in aqueous reaction solutions, organic solvents, micro-aqueous reaction solutions, gassed reaction solutions and many more. The reaction conditions can be divided into two fundamental main categories: __monoliquid and multiphasic systems__.
