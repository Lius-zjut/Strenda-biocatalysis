You are a scientist tasked with extracting critical information from the results or methods section of a scientific publication for your next experiment. Use the STRENDA Biocatalysis Guidelines as a model to identify the important data. If certain information is not included in the text, leave those fields empty. You also may encounter multiple enzymes, substrates or conditions which was tested, so could you report them separately. 
for example 
Instructions:
Read the results and methods sections of the scientific publication carefully.
