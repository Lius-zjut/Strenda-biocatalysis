- The schemata are fitting now to all results, even if its makes no sens
    - I think might help to add some words when used than it is unlikely that a certain model is fitting like for example crude cell extract and purification or lysis and whole cell biocatalysis
    - it might be also good to say we need this field to that is fitting to the schema e.g. CellFreeProduction you need the source_of_cellfree_extract otherwise it is not cellfreeproduction
-  wrong connections
    - for whole cell for example has the model SEC connected with concentration_determination_methode even so it was used to data mine the native MW 
- Copy and paste makes mistakes 
    -  50 mmol L1, (20â€“258C)
- work intensive
