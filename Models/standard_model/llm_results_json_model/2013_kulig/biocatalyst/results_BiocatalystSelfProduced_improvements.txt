Improvement Opportunities

Include the EC number and molecular weight of the enzyme to provide a more complete characterization.
Provide the amino acid and DNA sequences of the enzyme to enhance reproducibility and understanding of the biocatalyst.
Specify the origin and production organism to give context to the source and expression system used.
Detail any posttranslational modifications and purity specifications to ensure clarity on enzyme quality and modifications.
Describe any special treatments or conditions that are critical for the enzyme's activity or stability.
Description improvements

catalyzed_reaction: "The specific biochemical reaction that the biocatalyst facilitates, including substrates and products."
sequence_amino_acid: "The complete amino acid sequence of the biocatalyst, provided in either a one-letter or three-letter code, essential for understanding the protein's structure and function."
sequence_DNA: "The full DNA sequence of the biocatalyst, including any tags, linkers, or modifications, crucial for replication and expression studies."
origin_organism: "Detailed information about the species or source from which the enzyme is derived, including genus and species, to provide context on its natural occurrence."
purity_specification: "The method used to determine the enzyme's purity, such as gel electrophoresis or HPLC, to ensure the quality and consistency of the enzyme preparation."
Schema Improvements

Consider adding a field for "enzyme activity conditions" to capture specific conditions under which the enzyme is active, such as temperature, pH, and buffer composition.
Introduce a field for "enzyme stability data" to document the stability of the enzyme under various conditions, which is crucial for practical applications.
Add a "kinetic model" field to specify the type of kinetic model used for data analysis, providing clarity on the approach taken for kinetic parameter determination.
