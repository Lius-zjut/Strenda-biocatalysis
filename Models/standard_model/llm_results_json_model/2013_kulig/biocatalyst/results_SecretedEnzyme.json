  "special_treatment": "The enzyme was stored in different conditions to test stability, including in desalting buffer at 8째C and -20째C, in a mixture of 50% glycerol and desalting buffer at -20째C, and freeze-dried at -20째C. The enzyme was also purified with and without Ca2+ ions, and the native molecular weight was determined using SEC."
