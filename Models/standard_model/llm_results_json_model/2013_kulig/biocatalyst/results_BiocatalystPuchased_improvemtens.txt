Improvement Opportunities

Include the ec_number to provide a clear classification of the enzyme based on its biochemical function.
Provide the molecular_weight and molecular_weight_unit to give a complete understanding of the enzyme's size.
Add the sequence_amino_acid and sequence_DNA to offer detailed information about the enzyme's structure.
Specify the supplier to trace the origin of the enzyme.
Mention the production_organism to understand the context of heterologous gene expression.
Describe any posttranslational_modification to understand the enzyme's modifications.
State the purity and purity_specification to assess the quality of the enzyme.
Define the formulation to understand the physical state of the enzyme used in experiments.
Description improvements

catalyzed_reaction: "The specific chemical reaction that the biocatalyst facilitates, including substrates and products involved."
origin_organism: "The specific species or source from which the enzyme is derived or isolated, including genus and species, and the type of cell (bacterial, plant, animal, etc.)."
Schema Improvements

Consider adding a field for experimental_conditions to capture specific conditions under which the enzyme is tested, such as temperature, pH, and buffer composition.
Introduce a field for assay_methods to detail the methods used to measure enzyme activity, which can include spectrophotometric or chromatographic techniques.
Add a field for kinetic_parameters to capture detailed kinetic data such as Vmax, Km, and Ki, which are crucial for understanding enzyme behavior.
