Materials and Methods
Chemicals
All chemicals were of analytical grade. Alcohols (1–12),
aldehydes (13, 15–30), and ketones (31–40, 42–44) were
purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany).
Acetaldehyde (14) and acetophenone (41) were commercially available from Fluka (Steinheim, Germany) and Merck
(Darmstadt, Germany), respectively. NADP(H) was purchased from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany).

exclusion chromatography (SEC) for initial desalting of the
crude cell extracts, which was necessary to allow proper
binding of the enzyme to the anion exchanger. After anion
exchange chromatography a second SEC was used in order to
remove the sodium chloride and to adjust a proper
concentration of calcium ions for enzyme storage (Kulig
et al., 2012).

Storage Stability
In order to ﬁnd suitable storage conditions for RADH, the
puriﬁed and desalted enzyme was stored in four different
ways: (I) in desalting buffer (TEA–HCl, 10 mmol L1, pH
7.5) at 88C, (II) same as (I) but stored at 208C, (III) in a
mixture of 50% (v/v) glycerol and desalting buffer (stored at
208C) and (IV) freeze-dried and stored at 208C. For
comparison, residual activity was followed over time using
the standard reduction assay.

SDS Electrophoresis
SDS–PAGE (Laemmli, 1970) was carried out on a 4–12%
NuPAGE1 Novex Bis–Tris gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
For protein molecular weight estimations prestained
protein ladder PageRulerTM Plus (10–250 kDa, Fermentas,
Rockfold, IL) was applied. The gel was stained in SimplyBlueTM
SafeStain (Invitrogen) or by applying SilverXpress1 Silver
Staining Kit (Invitrogen; Supplementary Information,
Fig. S4A).

Determination of the Protein Concentration
For determination of protein concentrations the Bradford
method (Bradford, 1976) was applied using bovine serum
albumin (Fermentas) as a standard, whereby the Bradford
solution was prepared by ourselves.

Expression of Recombinant RADH
RADH cloned into the vector pET-22b(þ) was expressed
in E. coli BL21(DE3) from Novagen (Madison, WI) as
described previously (Kulig et al., 2012). Cultivation and cell
disruption procedures were described elsewhere as well
(Kulig et al., 2012).

Puriﬁcation
Here three puriﬁcation protocols of RADH were applied
depending on the purpose of the biochemical study. The ﬁrst
was conducted without Ca2þ ions, while for the second and
third protocol 0.2 and 0.8 mmol L1 CaCl2, respectively, were
added to all buffers. All puriﬁcation steps were performed in
TEA–HCl buffer, 50 mmol L1, pH 7.5 supplemented with
deﬁned concentrations of CaCl2, if needed. All puriﬁcation
steps were carried out at room temperature (20–258C).
The three-step puriﬁcation protocol employed a size
Determination of the Native Molecular Weight
The native molecular weight of RADH was determined by
SEC using a SuperdexTM 200 column (diameter: 26 mm,
length: 63 cm, gel bed volume: 334 mL, RADH loaded:
1.7 mL, RADH concentration: 3 mg mL1; GE Healthcare,
Uppsala, Sweden). The column was equilibrated with
50 mmol L1 TEA–HCl buffer, pH 7.5 containing
150 mmol L1 NaCl. The native molecular weight of
RADH was calculated according to a calibration curve
obtained with different standard proteins (for details see
Supplementary Information, Fig. S4B).

Oxidation Assay
Initial rate activities were measured spectrophotometrically
at 340 nm by following the formation (reduction) of

NADPH at 308C in semi-micro cuvettes (total volume 1 mL)
for 1 min. One unit (U) of enzyme is deﬁned as the amount
of enzyme that catalyzes the production of 1 mmol NADPH
per min at 308C for the respective substrate. The standard
oxidation reaction contained 100 mmol L1 cyclohexanol
and 0.5 mmol L1 NADPþ in 50 mmol L1 glycine–NaOH
buffer pH 10.5 including 0.8 mmol L1 CaCl2. Due to high
activity of cyclohexanol, even small changes in optima and
stability due to changes of reaction conditions could be
detected sensitively. All activity measurements were performed in triplicate.

Reduction Assay
Initial rate activities for reductions were measured
spectrophotometrically at 340 nm by following the consumption (oxidation) of NADPH at 308C in semi-micro
cuvettes (total volume 1 mL) for 1 min. One unit (U) of
enzyme is deﬁned as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the
consumption of 1 mmol of NADPH per min at 308C for the
respective substrate. The standard reduction assay contained
10 mmol L1 benzaldehyde and 0.2 mmol L1 NADPH
in 50 mmol L1 TEA–HCl buffer pH 7.5 including
0.8 mmol L1 CaCl2.

Effect of Salts
The effect of different metal chlorides on the initial rate
activity of RADH was studied using the standard reduction
assay containing 1 mmol L1 of the respective chloride.
Relative activities were calculated based on the initial
activity determined for RADH without salts. Salts
which did not reduce the initial rate activity (NaCl,
KCl, CaCl2, MgCl2) were further tested concerning their
effect on the enzyme stability at 08C. Therefore, the
decrease of activity was followed using the standard
reduction assay containing 1 mmol L1 of the respective
salt until a signiﬁcant drop of activity (of about 20%) was
observed.

Effect of pH
For estimation of the pH optima of the oxidation and
reduction reaction initial rate activities were measured using
different buffers for the reduction and oxidation assay
(citrate–phosphate, 50 mmol L1, pH 4.0–7.0; TEA–HCl,
50 mmol L1, pH 7.0–8.0; TRIS–HCl, 50 mmol L1, pH 7.0–
8.5; glycine–NaOH, 50 mmol L1, pH 8.5–12.0, all supplemented with CaCl2, 0.8 mmol L1). To study the pHdependent stability, the enzyme was incubated in the
different buffers at different pH-values at 258C and residual
activity was followed using the reduction assay until
complete deactivation was observed.

Effect of Temperature
For determination of the temperature optimum initial, rate
activities were determined with the reduction assay between
15 and 608C. The substrate solution was preheated in the
temperature-controlled slide of the spectrophotometer
(Shimadzu UV-1601) until the desired temperature was
reached. The temperature was additionally controlled with
an external thermocoupled thermometer with digital display
(Amarell, Kreutzwertheim, Germany). Shifts of pH due to
temperature increases are within a tolerable range (from 15
to 608C a pH shift of 0.9 was detected in the implemented
TEA–HCl buffer). In order to study temperature dependent
stability, the enzyme (concentration 0.5 mg mL1 in 200 mL
of stock solutions) was incubated in the reduction buffer
[TEA–HCl (50 mmol L1) þ CaCl2 (0.8 mmol L1), pH 7.5]
in a temperature range from 0 to 408C (Thermomixer
comfort, Eppendorf) and residual activity was followed
using the reduction assay until 50% deactivation was
observed at the respective temperature.

Substrate Range and Stereoselectivity
For investigation of the substrate range the assays for
reduction and oxidation were applied in the presence of
10 mmol L1 of each substrate, if not otherwise stated (see
Tables II–IV). Stereoselectivity of alpha-hydroxy ketone
biotransformations catalyzed by RADH was determined as
described previously (Kulig et al., 2012).

Determination of Kinetic Parameters
Kinetic parameters for the reduction of different aldehydes,
ketones, 2-HPP, and the oxidation of alcohols were
determined by initial rate activity measurements in triplicate
at various substrate concentrations and ﬁxed concentrations
of NADPH (0.2 mmol L1) and NADPþ (0.8 mmol L1),
respectively, in the respective standard buffers for reduction
or oxidation. Kinetic parameters for the cofactors were
determined at ﬁxed concentrations of benzaldehyde
(15 mmol L1) and cyclohexanone (100 mmol L1) for
the NADPH and for NADPþ using cyclohexanol
(100 mmol L1) as substrate. The v/[S]-plots are given in
the Supplementary Information, Fig. S7. Experimental data
were ﬁtted to suitable kinetic models with Origin 7G and
kinetic parameters (Vmax, KM, Ki, n) were calculated with the
same program.

Determination of Half-Lives
Half-lives in this work are deﬁned as the time after which a
residual activity of 50% was experimentally observed,
independent of the kinetic of the activity decay. All
deactivation curves are shown in the Supplementary
Information (Figs. S1–S3 and S5–S6). Only few of them
show ﬁrst order inactivation kinetics.
