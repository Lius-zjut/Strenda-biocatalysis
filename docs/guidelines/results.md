## Types


### KineticParameters
These parameters serve as benchmarks for understanding enzyme kinetics. The Km and kcat value is determined by all substrates involved in the reaction and not just one. Therefore, the concentrations of all substrates must be varied and the Km and kcat values calculated to obtain a common value instead of apparent values. For a comprehensive report around the technical key data of the kinetic parameters, see literature for further information, e.g. Pesci _et al._1, Bisswanger 2 .
