<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   [**Biocatalyst**](biocatalyst)

    ----

    Closely examining the role of the biocatalyst is a fundamental aspect in the context of enzymatic reactions.

-   [**Components**](components)

    ----

    Exploring the components involved in the reaction mixture is essential for a comprehensive understanding of enzymatic reactions.

- [**Results**](results)

    ----

    The systematic recording and description of experimental outcomes and data obtained from biocatalytic reactions.

- [**Operation Mode**](operation_mode)

    ----

    The operation mode is the first step in the experimental planning, it describes the mode in which the experiment was performed (e.g. batch, fed-batch, continuous)

- [**Reaction Conditions**](reaction_conditions)

    ----

    Examining the reaction conditions provides critical insights into the enzymatic reaction process.

- [**Sampling**](sampling)

    ----

    Understanding the sampling process is crucial for obtaining reliable data in enzymatic studies.

- [**Vessels and Mixing**](vessels_and_mixing)

    ----

    When discussing enzymatic reactions, it's essential to address the vessel type and its influence on mixing and hydrodynamics.
