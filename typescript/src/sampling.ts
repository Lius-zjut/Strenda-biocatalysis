/**
    Information about the sampling process, used during the experiment. In
    some experiments no sampling is taking place at all, for example,
    if an experiment is monitored via a photospectrometer in a 96-well
    plate over time.

    * @param volume_per_sample - Volume of the collected sample.
    * @param volume_per_sample_unit - Common units include mL (milliliters), Î¼l (microliters), g (grams), or
             other volume units, depending on whether the samples are
             liquid or solid.
    * @param mixing_during_sampling - Provide information about whether the reaction was mixed during
             sampling, as this can affect the representativeness of
             the collected sample.
    * @param vessel_opened_for_sampling - Information about whether the reaction vessel was opened for sampling
             or not.
    * @param gas_phase - Information about the composition of the gas phase above the reaction
             solution, including gases such as nitrogen, carbon
             dioxide, argon, oxygen or other gases.
    * @param time - The time at which the sample was taken.

    Sample preprocessing involves the necessary steps taken to

    experimentation.

    * @param quenching_method - Techniques or methods used to halt the reaction, including the
             chemicals or procedures employed (e.g., heat treatment).
             Accurate documentation of quenching methods in enzymatic
             reactions is vital as these methods can significantly
             impact subsequent analytical procedures. For instance,
             opting for an organic solvent as a quenching reagent can
             notably enhance the solubility of substrates or products,
             directly influencing downstream analyses.

             solution in relation to the reaction mixture. (
    * @param treatment_procedure - Any further details regarding the sample processing steps that were
             carried out after it was collected from the reaction
             vessel (e.g., filtering samples).
