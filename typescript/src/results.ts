/**
    These parameters serve as benchmarks for understanding enzyme
    kinetics. The Km and kcat value is determined by all substrates
    involved in the reaction and not just one. Therefore, the
    concentrations of all substrates must be varied and the Km
    and kcat values calculated to obtain a common value instead of
    apparent values. For a comprehensive report around the technical
    key data of the kinetic parameters, see literature for further
    information, e.g. Pesci _et al._1, Bisswanger 2 .

    * @param michaelis_constant - The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km​) represents the substrate
             concentration at which an enzyme achieves half of its
             maximum reaction rate.
    * @param michaelis_constant_unit - The unit of the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km​) is typically expressed
             as moles per liter (M or mM).
    * @param maximum_reaction_rate - Vmax, the maximum reaction rate, represents the speed at which an
             enzyme-catalyzed reaction reaches saturation, indicating
             the maximum achievable rate of product formation under
             optimal substrate concentration (where enzymes are
             predominantly saturated with substrates).
    * @param maximum_reaction_rate_unit - The unit of Vmax (maximum reaction rate) is typically represented
             as concentration per time, such as moles per liter per
             second (mol/L/s or mM/s).
    * @param turnover_number - The turnover number (kcat) measures the number of substrate molecules
             converted to product per active site of an enzyme
             per unit time when the enzyme is fully saturated with
             substrate.
    * @param turnover_number_unit - The unit of turnover number (kcat) is typically expressed as moles
             of product per mole of enzyme per second or per minute
             (time-1).
    * @param catalytic_efficiency - Catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) is a measure of how effectively an
             enzyme converts substrate into product, often quantified
             as the ratio of the turnover number (kcat) to the
             Michaelis-Menten constant (Km).
    * @param catalytic_efficiency_unit - The typical unit for catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) is M-1s-1.
    * @param dissociation_constant - The dissociation constant (Kd) is a measure that represents the
             equilibrium between a complex and its dissociated
             components.
    * @param dissociation_constant_unit - The dissociation constant (Kd) is typically expressed in M (mol per
             liter) or its derivatives, such as nM (nanomoles per
             liter).
    * @param inhibition_type - Enzyme inhibition encompasses various forms, including competitive,
             non-competitive, uncompetitive, mixed, and irreversible
             inhibition. Each type has different effects on the
             enzyme's function and plays a crucial role in regulating
             biochemical processes.
    * @param inhibition_constant - The inhibition constant (Ki) describes the affinity of an inhibitor
             for an enzyme. It indicates how effectively an inhibitor
             influences enzyme activity. A lower Ki value suggests a
             strong binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme.
    * @param inhibition_constant_unit - The units for the inhibition constant (Ki) are commonly expressed in M
             (mol per liter) or related units.
    * @param hill_coefficient - The Hill coefficient is a parameter used to describe cooperativity
             in the binding of molecules to proteins. It is employed
             in enzyme reactions, e.g. oxygen binding to hemoglobin,
             to indicate whether there is positive (cooperative) or
             negative (anticooperative) binding. A Hill coefficient
             greater than 1 indicates positive cooperativity, while
             a value less than 1 indicates negative cooperativity. A
             value of exactly 1 indicates no cooperativity.
    * @param enzyme_stability - The stability of enzymes is often characterized by various parameters
             such as the enzyme's half-life under specific conditions,
             the decline in activity over time, or the preservation
             of catalytic activity under different environmental
             conditions.
    * @param special_treatment - If there are any other specific metrics, parameters, characteristics
             or aspects related to the kinetics that are important
             to document the results accurately and are not described
             by the aforementioned metadata, they should be explained
             here.

    _et al._3.

    * @param c_yield - Yield represents the amount of the desired product obtained from a
             reaction. It is the number of synthesized molecules of
             product per number of starting molecules. The following
             formula can be used: $$Y_p = \frac{n_p - n _ {p0}}{n _

             quantity of product acquired post downstream processing
             (DSP).

    * @param space_time_yield - Space-time yield in biocatalysis refers to the mass of product
             obtained per unit volume of the reactor per unit
             time. Other terms commonly used in the literature are
             volumetric productivity or the reactor productivity . The
             following formula can be used: $$STY = \frac{m_p}{𝜏 \cdot
             V_R}$$ where, STY - space-time yield (g L-1 h-1), mp -
             mass of the synthesized product (g), 𝜏 - residence time r
             reaction time (h), VR - reactor volume.
    * @param space_time_yield_unit - Space-time yield is commonly expressed in g/L/h (grams per liter per
             hour) or mol/L/h (moles per liter per hour).
    * @param conversion - The term "conversion" refers to the percentage of substrate that
             undergoes transformation into the desired product during
             a reaction. It is the number of converted molecules per
             number of starting molecules. The following formula can
             be used: $$X_s = \frac{n _ {s0} - n_s}{n _ {s0}}$$ where,
             Xs - conversion of the substrate s (-), ns0 - amount
             of substrate s at the start of the reaction (mol), ns -
             amount of substrate s at the end of the reaction (mol).
    * @param conversion_unit - The conversion is commonly expressed as a percentage (%) to indicate
             the proportion of substrate converted to the desired
             product during a specific reaction.
    * @param special_treatment - If there are any other specific metrics, parameters, characteristics
             or aspects related to the conversion or yield that are
             important to document the results accurately and are not
             described by the aforementioned attributes, they should
             be explained here.

    specificity, see literature for further information, e.g. Faber4,
    Liese _et al._3, Schurig5.

    * @param stereoselectivity - Stereoselectivity refers to the preference of a chemical reaction to

             trait highlights the enzyme's ability to favor a specific
             enantiomer either as a product or as the preferred
             substrate for a reaction.
    * @param enantiomeric_excess - The enantiomeric excess ( ee ) measures the degree of purity and

             of chemical bond or functional group over others in
             a molecule.
    * @param regioselectivity - Regioselectivity refers to the preference of a reaction to occur at
             a specific site within a molecule or compound that has

    Understanding the energy dynamics and spontaneity of reactions through

    For a comprehensive report around the technical key data of the
    kinetic parameters, see literature for further information, e.g.
    Heintz6.

    * @param gibbs_free_energy_change - The Gibbs free energy ( G ) represents the portion of energy
             capable of performing work in a reaction under constant
             temperature and pressure, providing insights into the
             spontaneity of the reaction. While the absolute value of
             the free energy cannot be measured directly, the change
             in free energy (Δ G ) throughout the reaction, known as
             free reaction enthalpy, is measurable. As indicated by
             the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, it depends on changes in
             enthalpy (heat content) and entropy (system disorder)
             during the reaction. Δ G Δ G = 0: The system is at
             equilibrium; no work is performed. Δ G > 0: The reaction
             does not proceed spontaneously; it is endergonic . A
             supply of free energy is required to drive the reaction.
    * @param enthalpy_change - The enthalpy ( H ) represents the heat content within a system,
             expressing the quantity and nature of chemical
             bonds. This thermodynamic property cannot be measured
             independently. However, measurable is the change in
             enthalpy (Δ H ), which refers to the amount of heat
             absorbed or released during a chemical reaction (under
             constant pressure), also known as the reaction enthalpy.
             Δ H > 0: Heat energy is supplied; the reaction is
             endothermic . Δ H Δ S > 0: The disorder of the system
